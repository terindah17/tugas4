URL - Uniform Resource Locator
Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.

The URL is the address of a web page, like: https://www.w3schools.com.

URL Encoding (Percent Encoding)
URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.

URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set.

Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.
